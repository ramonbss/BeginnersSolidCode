# BeginnersSolidCode

A collection of classic beginner games in Python, created while studying clean code and software architecture.

The idea was simple: take those infamous "12 Python Projects for Beginners" YouTube tutorials and refactor them into something that actually follows good practices — proper separation of concerns, SOLID principles, and readable code.

## Games

- **Guess Game** — Number guessing game
- **Rock Paper Scissors** — The classic
- **Hangman** — Word guessing game
- **Tic Tac Toe** — With Player vs Player, Player vs Computer, and Computer vs Computer modes
